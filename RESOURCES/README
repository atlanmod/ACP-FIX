IFIP SEC Lisbonn 2019

%%%% Examples and source code prototype for the removing process

========== Requirements

    Python v.3.7
    Z3 v.4.6
    Z3py

========== How to use

SEE EXAMPLES/STOLLER2007/Stoller2007V1/roles2007.py

use compute_table(size) to get the enumerative results
then choose some problems and the binary chracteristic
ex
### second
U2 = Exists(table.variables, And(Not(And(Patient(T, X), PrimaryDoctor(T, X))), And(Receptionist(T, X), Doctor(T, X))))
UB2 = [0, 1] 
and use  print(str(table.lookup_complex(U2, UB2, size))) to get the F selection

========== Repository structure

RESOURCES/

main.pdf is the companion paper with full proofs
slides.pdf the talk

EXAMPLES/ contains some examples mainly an ARBAC and an ABAC ones
		ContinueA : ACP example originally in XACML
		Stoler2007: an healthcare ARBAC policy 


src/ contains the same base code than ACP (https://github.com/atlanmod/ACP) which defines the enumerative approach
but few changes and corrections have been done
src/improve and src/removing are new source codes for the removing process
